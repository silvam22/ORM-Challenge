## Description
This project is designed to build the back-end for an e-commerce site using Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It provides models and routes for managing products, categories, tags, and product tags. The project is aimed at helping developers gain experience in building scalable and robust back-end applications for e-commerce sites and learn how to interact with a database using Sequelize.
